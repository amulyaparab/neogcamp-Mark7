- Description:
  This app was made using HTML, CSS, and vanillaJS. It is a translation app, that converts English into morse code. The purpose of this app was for beginners to understand vanillaJS or javascript in browser.

* How it works:
  The app takes input from the user in the form of text in English, upon clicking the translate button it gives it to a translation API and thereby showing output in the required language, in this case: morse code.
